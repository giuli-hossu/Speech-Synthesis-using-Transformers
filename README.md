## Description of the Topic

### Vocal Synthesis
Vocal synthesis involves the artificial formation of human speech. 

### Transformers
Transformers are a class of deep learning models that have shown significant success in various natural language processing tasks.

#### General Aspects
This section discusses the fundamental aspects of transformer models.

#### SpeechT5 - A Transformer for Text-to-Speech (TTS)
SpeechT5 is a specific transformer model designed for the task of text-to-speech conversion.

#### HiFIGAN - A Transformer for Vocoder
HiFIGAN is another transformer-based model tailored for vocoder tasks.

## Implementation
This section provides details on how to implement transformer-based speech synthesis models.

## Experimental Results
Here, we present the results obtained from experiments conducted with the implemented models.

## Conclusion
We summarize our findings and discuss the implications of using transformer-based approaches for speech synthesis.

## Bibliography
A list of references used in this project.
